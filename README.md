# Cemu Plugin for GOG Galaxy 2.0

Requires Cemu to be installed. This implementation is a modification of the [Citra Plugin](https://github.com/j-selby/galaxy-integration-citra).

## Features

* Library: Wii U games (in decrypted NUS format with code, content and meta folder, not .wud or .wux) in your ROM folder
* Library: Imports your playtime and last time played for games from Cemu
* Launch: Launches games with Cemu in Fullscreen

Supports launching games (only NUS format supported, i.e. a folder with a code, content and meta folder) and tracking playtime (updated on startup).
