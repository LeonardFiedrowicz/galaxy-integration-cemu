# Cemu Plugin for GOG Galaxy

Requires Cemu to be installed. This implementation is a modification of the [Citra Plugin](https://github.com/j-selby/galaxy-integration-citra) 

Supports launching games (only NUS format supported, i.e. a folder with a code, content and meta folder) and tracking playtime (updated on startup).
